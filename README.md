# Contact-Mobile-Application
You are a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, a software engineering company that focuses on developing and testing back-end services. You’ve been given an assignment to develop a mobile application for a customer. 

When given this assignment, the first thing I did was reviewed the requirements from the client. The client had certain requirements when it came to adding, updating or deleting a contact, task, or appointment. If they were not met then the software would display a message informing the user. If the requirements were met the system would execute the command based on what the user wanted to do. Through my tests, I am able to make sure my software is functional and secure. It confirmed that the requirements were met and the system worked as intended. I tested different scenerios that the user would encounter. I also received help from others that gave me more ideas of different types of test and how to improve my code.
