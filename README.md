# Contact-Mobile-Application
You are a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, a software engineering company that focuses on developing and testing back-end services. You’ve been given an assignment to develop a mobile application for a customer. The customer will provide you with the requirements. Your job is to code up the application and provide unit tests to verify that it meets the customer’s requirements. You will be delivering the contact, task, and appointment services. The purpose of these services is to add, update, and delete contact, task, and appointment objects within the application. 

When given this assignment, the first thing I did was reviewed the requirements from the client. The client had certain requirements when it came to adding, updating or deleting a contact, task, or appointment. If they were not met then the software would display a message informing the user. If the requirements were met the system would execute the command based on what the user wanted to do. Through my tests, I am able to make sure my software is functional and secure. It confirmed that the requirements were met and the system worked as intended. I tested different scenerios that the user would encounter. I also received help from others that gave me more ideas of different types of test and how to improve my code.
